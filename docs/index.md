# About Us

JustCause is a crowdfunding platform that allows users to leverage the power of defi to fund causes that are important to them. We use an innovative funding mechanism to allow users to contribute to public goods, charitable organizations, DAOs, local/global/personal causes, and much more.

Users participate as either Contributors or Pool Creators. Pool Creators generate JustCause Pools representing a cause in need of funding. Contributors deposit tokens into JustCause Pools which in turn deposit them into Aave’s lending protocol. The interest earned is donated to the cause associated with the Pool. When Contributors need access to their funds, they simply withdraw their original deposit and the interest accrued is left behind for the cause.

# Our Mission

JustCause is an open source, permissionless and non-custodial protocol. This means that anyone has the freedom to create or contribute to pools with a user interface or interact directly with the smart contracts on the network. This freedom lies at the heart of the difference between permissioned (closed) and permissionless (open) systems.

Our mission is to give users the freedom to create and fund any cause they deem worthy. Crowdfunding mechanisms based on traditional financial payment networks are inherently permissioned and custodial. This leaves the funds and users of these systems vulnerable to financial censorship. We want to solve this problem.

## Contract Overview

PoolTracker, JustCausePool, and JCDepositorERC721 are the three contracts in the JustCause protocol. Together these contracts allow for four main processes: pool creation, deposit, withdraw, and claim

PoolTracker coordinates all major functionality of the protocol. It is the only address with permission to execute the pool creation, deposit, withdraw, and claim processes in JustCause.

PoolTracker OP Mainnet Address: [0x9ff20439a4F5e315A48E5714d0f989f18DE77684](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9ff20439a4f5e315a48e5714d0f989f18de77684)

### Pool Creation

To create a new pool the `createJCPoolClone` method of PoolTracker is called. This method generates proxy contracts for both JustCausePool and JCDepositorERC721. In the JustCause protocol each pool/cause has its own JustCausePool smart contract clone and ERC721 token.

The JustCausePool contract stores the user deposits in the form of [aTokens](https://docs.aave.com/developers/tokens/atoken) keeping track of the total deposits for each of the accepted assets.

The JCDepositorERC721 contract acts as an on-chain receipt of user deposits into the JustCausePool. Individual contributor’s deposit information is stored and updated in the ERC721 contract.

### Deposit

When contributors deposit into pools the `addDeposit` method of PoolTracker is called. The PoolTracker contract is the point of contact for deposits into Aave liquidity pools. The JustCausePool and JCDepositorERC721 are sent the deposit information to update the balances accordingly.

### Withdraw

When contributors want to withdraw their deposits the `withdrawDeposit` method of PoolTracker is called. The JustCausePool contract is the point of contact for withdrawals from Aave liquidity pools. The contributor’s balance is updated in the JCDepositorERC721 contract.

### Claim

When any user wishes to claim the donations from Aave and send them to the receiver address the `claimInterest` method of PoolTracker is called. Claims work similar to withdrawals except that the amount withdrawn is the JustCausePool balance of aTokens subtracted by the total deposits for a given token.

<div id="donations" class="hidden" markdown="1">

# Lossless Donations

JustCause smart contracts let users give to charity without actually giving their hard earned money!

### Aave

JustCause Pools generate interest through an integration with the [Aave lending protocol](https://docs.aave.com/hub/). Aave can be thought of as an automated system of liquidity pools. Users deposit tokens they want to lend out, which are amassed into reserve pools. Borrowers may then draw from these pools by taking out collateralized loans. In exchange for providing liquidity to the market lenders earn a passive rate of interest on their deposits.

With lending protocols like Aave risk exists because the financial value behind the collateral and borrowed debt can fluctuate significantly due to the volatility of crypto markets. To mitigate this risk, Aave requires loans to be overcollateralized, meaning the collateral is always worth more than the debt being borrowed. To maintain solvency, positions nearing under collateralization are liquidated (collateral is sold to pay back the debt), protecting lenders and keeping all positions over 100% collateralized.

The Aave Protocol has been audited, and has an ongoing bug bounty program. It secures tens of billions of dollars of value. The protocol is completely open source, allowing anyone to interact and build on top of it. Every possible step has been taken to minimize the risk as much as possible. However, no platform can be considered entirely risk free. Please see the [Aave risk framework](https://docs.aave.com/risk/) for more details.

### Fund a Cause

Through lossless donations, JustCause is able to charge no fees to Contributors. To donate users go to the Dashboard to see JustCause's Verified Pools. Alternatively, users search for user generated pools by name or contract address.

Users share causes they create or feel passionate about on social media by clicking the share icons in the  Pool. This creates a post with a link on the platform for friends to follow and contribute.

Contributors are able to see and withdraw deposits from pools they have contributed to under Contributions in the Dashboard tab. 

### Contributor NFT’s

Another unique feature of JustCause is that the deposit information for the users and pool creators is stored on-chain in the form of an NFT’s (non-fungible tokens). A Pool Creator has the option of uploading an image at the time of pool creation. An NFT is generated of the image for the Contributors to the pool. The Contributor’s token acts as an on-chain receipt by storing data on their funds deposited in the Pool. It is for this reason that contributor NFT’s are non-transferable. The only way to get one is to deposit for the cause.

</div>

<div id="cause" class="hidden" markdown="1">

# Your Cause

We want to make it so anyone can create and fund a cause on JustCause.

Every cause on JustCause is funded through a Pool. Think of a Pool as a savings account that generates interest on deposits. Any interest generated gets automatically donated to the cause. JustCause has two types of pools: Verified Pools and User pools.

### Verified Pools

Verified pools are created by the team, and the recipient of the funds are known and established entities.  In short, any user who contributes knows where the donations are going.

All verified pools can be found under verified causes in the Dashboard tab.

### User Pools

User pools are generated by pool creators utilizing the protocol’s smart contracts. The recipients of the funds are specified by the creators at the time of generation.

It is important to note that anyone can create a user pool for any reason. More importantly, the allocation of funds cannot be accounted for in most circumstances. Therefore, it is crucial that users take caution when contributing to user pools. We advise only contributing to user pools when both the pool creator and receiver are trusted entities.

User pools can be found by searching by name or contract address.

### Your Cause

Donations must be claimed through a transaction on the blockchain. No fee is charged by JustCause.

# FAQ

---

### What is JustCause?

JustCause is a decentralized non-custodial crowdfunding protocol where users participate as Contributors or Pool Creators. Contributors deposit funds that are used in the Aave lending protocol to generate donations for public goods, charitable organizations, DAOs, local/global/personal causes, and much more.

---

### Where are my deposited funds stored?

Your funds are allocated in a smart contract. The code of the smart contract is public, open source, and audited by third party auditors. You can withdraw your funds from the pool at any time.

---

### How do I interact with the JustCause protocol?

[JustCause dApp](https://www.justcause.finance/#/) is currently deployed on the Optimism (OP) network.

Users have the option to run the dApp locally by following the setup guide in our [readme file](https://github.com/smeee23/just_cause/blob/main/README.md).

---

### What is Optimism network?

Optimism Mainnet is a low-cost and lightning-fast Ethereum L2 blockchain powered by Optimism.

See: [Getting started on the OP Mainnet chain](https://www.optimism.io/)

---

### What is the cost of donating with JustCause protocol?

Contributors receive their full deposit back upon withdrawal, minus network transaction fees. Interacting with the protocol requires transactions and thus transaction fees onchain.

---

### What fee does JustCause charge?

No fee is charged by JustCause. However, a fee mechanism is built into the contracts. This rate can be raised to as high as 0.4% or lowered to 0 by the team to find an equilibrium that supports the causes as well as JustCause in the long run. This can only be done by the team multisig address. There are no plans to turn on the fee mechanism.


---


### Why use JustCause?

JustCause is an open source, permissionless and non-custodial protocol. This means that anyone has the freedom to create or contribute to pools.

Crowdfunding mechanisms based on traditional financial payment networks are inherently permissioned and custodial. This leaves the funds and users of these systems vulnerable to financial censorship. We want to solve this problem.

---

### What causes are allowed?

Our mission is to give users the freedom to create and fund any cause they deem worthy. Our contracts are immutable and permissionless by design. Anyone has the right to create a user cause and publish it on our user interface (ui). While anyone can interact with our contracts and [github respository](https://github.com/smeee23/just_cause) we do reserve the right to remove causes from our team operated front end. This would only be done in extreme cases, eg. promotion of violence of any kind.

The team has no control over user funds deposited into pools.

---

### Is there any risk?

The risks related to the JustCause platform are the smart contract risk (risk of a bug within the protocol code and the Aave protocol code) and liquidation risk (risk on the collateral liquidation process on Aave). Every possible step has been taken to minimize the risk as much as possible-- the protocol code is public and open source and it has been audited.

---

### How much will my contributions donate?

JustCause Pools receive continuous earnings from Aave that evolve with market conditions based on:

The interest rate payment on loans – on Aave depositors share the interests paid by borrowers corresponding to the average borrow rate times the utilization rate. The higher the utilization of a reserve the higher the yield for depositors.

Flash Loan fees – on Aave depositors receive a share of the Flash Loan fees corresponding to .09% of the Flash Loan volume.

On Aave each asset has its own market of supply and demand with its own APY (Annual Percentage Yield) which evolves with time.

---

### Is there a minimum or maximum amount to deposit?

Users are able to deposit any amount they want, there is no minimum or maximum limit.

---

### What tokens are allowed to be deposited?

JustCause Pool creators choose what tokens to accept at pool creation. They can choose from Optimism Mainnet USDC, DAI, WBTC, and ETH.

# Risks

### JustCause

Every possible step has been taken to minimize the risk to user funds as much as possible. We have been audited

However, JustCause is a brand new social experiment. Before deciding to participate in JustCause, you should carefully consider your objectives, level of experience with crypto and risk appetite. Most importantly, do not deposit money with JustCause you cannot afford to lose. Crypto markets are very risky and you may lose all or some of your deposits.

The risks related to the JustCause platform are the smart contract risk (risk of a bug within the protocol code and the Aave protocol code) and liquidation risk (risk on the collateral liquidation process on Aave).

### Aave

The Aave Protocol has been audited, and has an ongoing bug bounty program. It secures tens of billions of dollars of value. The protocol is completely open source, allowing anyone to interact and build on top of it. Every possible step has been taken to minimize the risk as much as possible. However, no platform can be considered entirely risk free.

### Permanent loss of a peg

If one of the stablecoins deposited in a JustCause pool goes significantly down below the peg of $1.00 and never returns to the peg, it could mean the loss of user funds.

# JustCausePool
 ---

This contract is part of the JustCause Protocol for lossless donations using Aave v3. Full code can be found [here](https://github.com/smeee23/justcause_contracts/blob/main/contracts/deploy/JustCausePool.sol) in our github repository.

The protocol uses Aave to generate interest for crowdfunding. JustCausePool is a point of contact with the Aave Pool contract, and where the protocol stores the deposited [aTokens](https://docs.aave.com/developers/tokens/atoken).

> aTokens are tokens minted and burnt upon supply and withdraw of assets to an Aave market, which denote the amount of crypto assets supplied and the yield earned on those assets. The aTokens’ value is pegged to the value of the corresponding supplied asset at a 1:1 ratio and can be safely stored, transferred or traded. All yield collected by the aTokens' reserves are distributed to aToken holders directly by continuously increasing their wallet balance. - Aave Documentation

*Functions withdraw() and withdrawDonations() directly interact with the Aave Pool.*

*Deposits are performed through the PoolTracker contract to minimize approvals.*

# JCDepositorERC721
---

This contract is part of the JustCause Protocol for lossless donations using Aave v3. Full code can be found [here](https://github.com/smeee23/justcause_contracts/blob/main/contracts/deploy/JCDepositorERC721.sol) in our github repository.

JCDepositorERC721 creates an ERC721 (NFT) for each Contributor, which acts as a digital receipt storing information about their donations. It is for this reason that the NFTs cannot be sold/transferred from the original Contributor's wallet. The only way to get a JustCausePool NFT is to **donate!**


The contract inherits from the [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) contract ERC721URIStorageUpgradeable.  Each JCDepositorERC721 is created through a proxy contract and matches 1:1 with a specific JustCausePool contract.


User deposit information is stored in a Deposit `struct`

``` solidity
struct Deposit {
	uint256 balance;
	uint256 timeStamp;
	address asset;
}

```

A mapping links unique tokenId’s to Deposit information.

```solidity
mapping (uint256 => Deposit) deposits;
```

 The tokenId consists of a keccak hash of the addresses of the Contributor, JustCausePool, and reserve asset

```solidity
uint256 tokenId = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_tokenOwner, jcPool, _asset)))

```

# PoolTracker

This contract is part of the JustCause Protocol for lossless donations using Aave v3. Full code can be found [here](https://github.com/smeee23/justcause_contracts/blob/main/contracts/deploy/PoolTracker.sol) in our github repository.

PoolTracker coordinates all major functionality of the protocol.

It generates the proxy contracts for both JustCausePool and JCDepositorERC721 and is the only address with permission to execute their write methods.

The PoolTracker contract also interacts directly with Aave [Pool](https://docs.aave.com/developers/core-contracts/pool#view-methods) and [WETHGateway](https://docs.aave.com/developers/periphery-contracts/wethgateway) when Contributors make donations through the addDeposit function. This makes approvals required only once per token. The withdrawDeposit and claim functions do not interact with the Aave contracts directly. This interaction is handled by the JustCausePool contract.
